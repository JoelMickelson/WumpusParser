Wumpus Parser

There is gold in a custom dungeon, but you'll need to navigate through it based on memory, senses, and logic in order to get the gold and defeat the vicious wumpus!

Commands -

look: shows information about the current room (as when entering it)
climb, exit, leave: use the stairs to leave the dungeon and end the game
take, grab, get: obtain the gold treasure
shoot (north, south, east, west): kills the wumpus if it is in that adjacent room
go (north, south, east, west): moves in that direction
quit: exits the program immediately

You can also use shorthand for directions: n, s, e, w.


Gameplay -

The dungeon is very dark, and it is easy to fall into a pit or right into the clutches of the wumpus itself!

Fortunately, you will feel a breeze in the air if there are pits nearby, and the wumpus has a terrible smell.

You also have a bow with one arrow. The arrow will not travel far, and can only be used once.


Scoring -

leaving the dungeon alive: +1000
killing the wumpus: +1000
getting the gold: +1000
dying: -1000
each action: -1


Design:

Hunt the Wumpus is a classic computer game, with many variants. It is now commonly used for AI education, as it is a pretty easy partially-observable domain to implement. Of course, there's nothing wrong with playing the game itself. In this case, it is sort of a Zork-like text adventure. Note, however, that the command set is so small that I didn't bother with a real parser (the 'parser' in the title just indicates that it's a text adventure). Other expectations of the genre, such as an inventory or complicated geography, are also missing.
